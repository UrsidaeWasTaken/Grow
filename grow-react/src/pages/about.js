            GROW is a fun little project to get a better understanding of various frameworks and languages by building a full-stack framework from scratch. It is made with Javascript/React for the frontend, C#/ASP.NET API for the backend, and Microsoft Server as a database. I've used some other applications like Postman for API testing and Unsplash for images.
