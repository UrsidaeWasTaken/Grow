# Grow

![Grow]

**GROW** is a fun little project to get a better understanding of various frameworks and languages by building a full-stack website from scratch. It is made with Javascript (React) for the frontend, C# (ASP.NET API) for the backend, and Microsoft Server as the database. I've used some other applications like Postman for API testing and Unsplash for images.
